### About our webapp: 
Our webapp has two main functionalities:
1. Confide - Send a whisper
  * A whisper is a message that describes a struggle or worry, it could be obstacles that you are facing in life or past trauma that you want to share. Each person can create a whisper and send it anonymously to a random stranger. Each whisper can be assigned any number of tags during creation, and they are used to categorize the message (sample categories: domestic violence, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, etc). 

3. Resonate - Hear others' whispers
   * You can view other's whispers and respond to them by sending back a message or simply clicking supportive buttons like "I feel you", "Hope things are better", and "I support you"
