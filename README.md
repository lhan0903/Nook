### About our webapp: 
Our webapp has two main functionalities:
1. Confide - Send a whisper
  * Each person can write a message in a textbox and assign any number of tags to the message. A message should be a struggle or it could be obstacles they are facing in life or past trauma that they want to share. The tags categorizes the message (sample categories: domestic violence, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, etc). 

3. Resonate - Hear other's whispers
   * to be updated
